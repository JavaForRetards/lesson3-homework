# Assignment 3: Class Inheritance
This repo contains the code used in the [summary of the third lesson](https://github.com/JavaForRetards/.github/blob/master/summaries/3-methods-and-classes.md). I want you to fork this and do the following things:

- Fork this repository.
	- Forking means creating your own copy of a public GitHub repository. You can do so by clicking the "Fork" button on the top right.
- Clone your copy of the repository.
- Create the following new classes, with appropriate superclasses and interfaces: `Fox`, `Snake`, `Pidgeon`.
- Add a method to `IScientificallyNameable` to print the correct biological kingdom, and implement it appropriately.
- Come up with a way to specify the subspecies or race (let's assume they are synonyms) for animals, when applicable. I'm giving you no hints on how to do this, let's see what you come up with!
- Edit the `main` method to test all of the new features.

Anybody who turns in something correctly abstracted wins a GBP. There is very little that can go wrong this time, so no point in beating off about efficiency. Good luck!
